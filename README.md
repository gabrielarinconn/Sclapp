## 📌 Overview

SCLAPP is a system designed to help training organizations like **Riwi** identify companies that may need technology talent.

The system analyzes **remote job postings** from public job platforms and uses **AI classification** to detect relevant roles, technologies, and companies that could become hiring partners.

The goal of the MVP is to demonstrate a complete pipeline:

1. Collect remote job postings  
2. Filter relevant technology jobs  
3. Classify jobs using AI  
4. Extract technologies  
5. Score companies based on relevance  
6. Store results in PostgreSQL  
7. Visualize insights in a dashboard

# ❗ Problem the System Solves

Training organizations often struggle to identify companies that are actively hiring technology talent.

Manual research is slow and inefficient.

SCLAPP automates this process by:

- analyzing job postings
- identifying companies hiring technical roles
- extracting technologies used in those roles
- highlighting companies with higher hiring relevance

This helps organizations focus their outreach efforts on companies more likely to need trained talent.

# 🎯 MVP Scope

The MVP focuses on validating the core concept:

- Scraping remote job postings
- Filtering relevant technical jobs
- AI-based classification of job relevance
- Technology extraction
- Company scoring
- Dashboard visualization

The system demonstrates a **complete end-to-end data pipeline**, from job collection to insights visualization.

# 🌐 Scraping Sources

The MVP currently supports two remote job platforms:

- **Remotive**
- **RemoteOK**

Each source is implemented as a scraper module that collects job postings and normalizes the data before processing.

Future versions may include additional sources.

---

# 🤖 AI Classification Logic

The AI classifier analyzes job descriptions and determines:

- role category (Backend, Frontend, Data, DevOps, etc.)
- job relevance
- company score

Score scale:

| Score | Meaning |
|------|------|
| 1 | Low relevance |
| 2 | Medium relevance |
| 3 | High relevance |

---

# ⚙ Technology Extraction

The system identifies technologies mentioned in job descriptions.

Examples:

- Python
- JavaScript
- React
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
- AWS
- Pandas

Technologies are stored in a separate table and linked to companies through a relational table.

---

# 🗄 Database Structure

### company

Stores companies detected in job postings.

| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| name | Company name |
| category | Role category |
| score | AI relevance score |
| country | Job location |

---

### technologies

Stores extracted technologies.

Examples:

- Python
- React
- Docker
- PostgreSQL

---

### company_technologies

Many-to-many relationship between companies and technologies.

---

### scraping_logs

Stores execution logs for each scraping process.

Includes:

- source
- execution time
- number of jobs processed
- new vs updated companies
